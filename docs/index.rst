Peace of Mind
=============

This is a set of tools, arranged as a single library that helps someone keep
tabs on their core digital assets.  Losing your domain name or letting your
SSL certificates expire can lead to hundreds if not thousands of dollars in
damage to your bottom line in the best cast.  In the worst care your customers
may lose faith in your company or brand.

These tools will power a subscription web service that will give individuals,
startups, and enterprise customers full faith that their assets are being
monitored and will be alerted, ahead of time if possible, that their
core assets are at risk or have been altered.
